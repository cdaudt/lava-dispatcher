# Configuration example
# Each dispatcher might have a configuration file like this one.
# Use the fully qualified hostname of the worker as the filename,
# as shown in the lava-master logs, and create the file in
# /etc/lava-server/dispatcher.d on the *master*.

# Only set this key, if this dispatcher has many IPs
#dispatcher_ip: <this-dispatcher-ip>

# Set this key, if you want to change the default lxc creation path
# No trailing /
# The default path is /var/lib/lxc
#lxc_path: <custom-path>
